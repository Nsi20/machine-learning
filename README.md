# Restaurant Rating Prediction
Objective: Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.



## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine-learning model that predicts the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features such as cuisine, location, price range, and online delivery options. The project uses a dataset of restaurant information and employs regression algorithms to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about restaurants, including their name, location, cuisine, price range, customer ratings, and other relevant features. You can find the dataset in the file named `Dataset (1).csv`. Make sure to include this file in your project directory.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    - The dataset is loaded using the pandas library.
    - Missing values in the 'Cuisines' column are filled with the mode.
    - Categorical features are encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical representations.

2. **Feature Selection and Engineering:**
    - Relevant features are selected for model training.
    - New features can be engineered from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
    - A regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression) is selected and trained on the training data.
    - The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

4. **Model Interpretation and Analysis:**
    - The model's results are interpreted to understand the relationships between features and restaurant ratings.
    - The most influential features affecting ratings are identified and analyzed.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:
    - 2. **Run the Notebook:**
    - Open the Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
    - Execute the code cells in order.
    - The notebook will load the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and display the results.

## Results and Insights

- The model's performance is evaluated using MSE and R-squared on the testing set.
- Insights into the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings are provided.
- Limitations of the model and potential areas for improvement are discussed.
